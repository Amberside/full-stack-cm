Now that we have set up our reducers, actions and store,
We need to add redux to our components.
To do this we will first rename all the components in our contacts folder 
to a .bak on the end.
1. rename all conctact components to .bak
2. create new AddContact.js
3. create new EditContact.js
4. create new Contacts.js
5. create new SingleContact.js
6. Open Contacts.js
