Now we can look at connecting our server to our front end.
To do this we create a folder called contact_manager
inside of contact_manager we place our client-side code 
in a folder called client. 
And we place our server side code in a folder called server.
1. Create the contact_manager folder
2. create the client folder and move your client-side code into it.
3. Create the sever folder and move your server-side code into it.

Note: Remember to install the node packages for client-side and 
server-side applications as needed.
in the client folder run npm i to install all the packages you need
in the server folder run npm i to install all the packages you need.
Remember this list is in our package.json files.
We can remove uuid from our client project as we are no longer using it.
to uninstall a package, it is npm uninstall <package_name>

4. open the client package.json file.
5. In this file we are adding the following code:
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",

6. open client/src/context.js
