Now we can look at adding in our database.
For this API we will use SQLite and the sequelize package.
For this to work we need to install some new packages.
The packages we are using are sequelize, sqlite3
https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize
https://sequelize.org/v6/
https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3
https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3
1. npm i sequelize
2. npm i sqlite3
3. create a models folder in the src folder
4. create index.js in the models folder
5. open index.js

Note: please look at https://sequelize.org/v6/manual/getting-started.html 
if you wish to use another database other then sqlite.
Databases that are supported are:
Postgress, MySql, Mariadb, Sqlite, tedious (for microsoft SQL server)
If you do change databases please double check the options you need to connect to the database.
For example with mysql, we do not need the storage option, but will need a port option to let the sever know which port the database uses for connections.
A full list of options can be found at:
