Redux is a state management container for React.
We use it as single source of truth for our react applicaitons. 
This means that we have one copy of our state for our whole application.
We can leverage this anywhere within our application.
To install redux for our applicaiton we need to include the following packages.
npm i redux
https://redux.js.org/
https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux
npm i react-redux
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux
npm i redux-thunk
https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk
npm i @redux-devtools/extension
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redux-devtools/extension

Redux uses actions created by the UI to dispatch to our reducers 
which will then update our state.
To begin we need to create the following:
in our src folder we need to create:
1. an actions folder.
  This folder will hold our actions
2. a reducers folder
  This folder will hold our reducers
in the src directory we need to create 
3.  a store.js
The store is what holds our state.

4. open store.js


Up until now, we have stored our actions inside our components.
Redux moves all of these into a seprate file. 
This means that all our actions are in the one spot and do not need written 
multiple times.
This is one way can optimise our code. (It is also called refactoring)
