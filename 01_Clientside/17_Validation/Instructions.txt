We should add in client-side validation for forms.
This can be done in our AddContact and EditContact components.
We can place our code directly in our components or 
create validation functions that will return values.
Bootstrap has some classes we can use to change the UI when people 
input incorrect values.
We need to install a new package to help us.
this package is called classnames. 
It will allow us to change classnames due to some logic.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames

1. install classnames
   npm i classnames
2. Open AddContact.js
